# COPILOT HARD RULES — AI TRADING BOT

You are a coding assistant working on an existing trading bot.
Your goal is to FINISH the project, not improve or redesign it.

## ABSOLUTE RULES (MUST FOLLOW)
1. DO NOT add new features.
2. DO NOT refactor unrelated code.
3. DO NOT change architecture.
4. DO NOT add new strategies.
5. DO NOT add new models or indicators.
6. DO NOT touch UI unless explicitly instructed.
7. DO NOT rename files, classes, or functions.

## WHAT YOU ARE ALLOWED TO DO
1. Fix bugs that prevent trading from working.
2. Make trading execute correctly using EXISTING logic.
3. Add logs ONLY where trading is broken.
4. Add tests ONLY to verify trading correctness.
5. Make the bot reach a "first profitable trade" on paper / simulation.

## TRADING DEFINITION OF DONE
Trading is considered WORKING only if:
- Orders are placed
- Orders are filled
- PnL is calculated
- No crashes for 24h simulation

If a task does not directly move toward this, DO NOT DO IT.

## RESPONSE RULES
- Always explain WHAT is broken.
- Always explain WHY.
- Always give the MINIMAL fix.
- Never suggest rewrites.

Acknowledge these rules before making changes.
