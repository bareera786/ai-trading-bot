# User Prompt Template

## How to ask for features or changes

- Be specific about the feature, page, or API you want.
- Mention if it is for admin, user, or both.
- Specify if you need backend, frontend, or both.
- Example: "Add a chart to the admin dashboard showing user activity by week."
- Example: "Allow users to update their email and password from the profile page."
- Example: "Add a robot control button for admins to restart the robot."
